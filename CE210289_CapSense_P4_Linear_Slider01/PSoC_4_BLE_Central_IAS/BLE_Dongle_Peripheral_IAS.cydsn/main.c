*                           THEORY OF OPERATION
*******************************************************************************
* This project works on CySmart USB Dongle and acts as a Find Me Reporter. 
* After the Central devices (PSoC_4_BLE_Central_IAS project on BLE Pioneer Kit)
* are connected, the Push Button on the BLE Pioneer Kit will rotate the Alert 
* level between No, Mid and High Alert on CySmart USB Dongle, which is demonstrated 
* by the different method of blinking LED. 
* Refer to BLE Pioneer Kit user guide for details.
